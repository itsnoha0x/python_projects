# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A simple **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using the **NSL-KDD dataset** to classify network traffic as normal or anomalous.

The project implements multiple machine learning models, including:

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

An **interactive Streamlit interface** allows you to explore the models and test traffic samples.

This project was developed as a **practice exercise** to apply machine learning concepts in Python.

To set it up: Decompress the two KDD zip files in the **same directory** as the scripts.
